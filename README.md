# 2023-2024-VRC_OverUnder-PCFresh
**The definitive Match Repository for the 2023-2024 VRC Over Under for the Pine Crest Upper School Robotics Team (#1388B)**<br>
This is the new _merged_ team 1388B, merged from 1388A and 1388B after TSA States. This team will be competing in TSA Nationals. The Code here will contain, but is not limited to, all driving and autonomous code FOR 1v1 MATCHES.

## Set Up

### Git Installation
Our project is hosted on a platform called GitHub, where different users can edit and change the same code. The software that is widely used to connect the online repository to your computer is a software called _git_. We will need to install git to allow for easy access and changes to the latest, newest code on our repo.

Download & Install Git: [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

**Recommended** Use Git with the built-in VS Code source control manager:

open Git Bash and type these following commands. These will let git know the name and the email of the person editing the code, so everyone can tie it back to you. Replace ```<text>``` (including the "<" ">") with your personal information.

```git config --global user.name "<first_name last_name>"```

```git config --global user.email "<your email>```

### Installation
**All instructions must be followed IN ORDER, as each depends on the last**<br>
Follow these instructions to download PROS (and VS Code, if necessary): [https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5/getting-started/](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5/getting-started/)

Inside VS Code, download the "C/C++" extension.

We use a library called LemLib to handle all PID and robot movement control to have an easy API as well as robust tools at our disposal.

Install LemLib here (current release version: v0.4.7): [https://github.com/LemLib/LemLib/releases/](https://github.com/LemLib/LemLib/releases/)]

I would recommend connecting your GitHub account to the built-in VS Code source control manager, to make pushing and pulling faster:[ https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github)
